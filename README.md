# jaw-clench-sensor
a device that senses whether a TMJ sufferer is clenching their jaw at night

Sensor that could be used:
1. FSRs could be embedded in a mouthguard device and the output could be logged overnight
2. Microphones could be placed on either cheek to listen for motion
3. Microphone could be placed inside a focused parabolic dish which faces the TMJ patient - clenching or grinding sounds could be recorded overnight and detected using FFT
